# Comcom - Command Composer

## What?

Command Composer (comcom) is an interactive utility designed to make it easier to write painfully long commands.

## Why?

Sometimes you need to write an annoyingly long command - whether it be to interact with Docker or to chain a long series of pipes

## How?

Comcom is written entirely in Rust ðŸ¦€ and powered by the [tui-rs](https://github.com/fdehau/tui-rs) library
